      <p className='text-justify py-4'>
        Counter-Strike was first developed in 1999, and ever since then, it has evolved through high
        tech innovations and modifications to become the world’s best online game. It gets even
        better because it is %100 FREE! No hidden fees or charges, click on the download button and
        get ready to enjoy the most entertaining first-shooter game ever. How it all started
      </p>

      <p className='text-justify py-4'>
        Ever since its first release by Valve L.L.C from designers Ming Le and Jesse Cliffe over two
        decades ago, and sill yet, Counter-Strike is still played all over the world till today.
        Jesse Cliffe and Ming Le forged an unbreakable partnership at a time when game creators paid
        little or no attention to realistic games. Science fiction games ruled the day. Ming Le and
        Jesse Cliffe were part of the team who developed Action Quake II, but it was Ming Le who
        proposed the idea to create a multiplayer free game that combines weapons and
        anti-terrorism. Upon creation, several remakes have been made, but Counter-Strike 1.6 is the
        final major software update of the game. HOW TO PLAY COUNTERSTRIKE
      </p>

      <p className='text-justify py-4'>
        Counter-Strike is one of the most-played games of all times. As a result of its competitive
        nature, Counter-Strike takes you on an exciting journey that requires hours of gameplay to
        perfection.
      </p>
      <h3 className='text-2xl text-amber-300'>START OF THE GAME</h3>

      <p className='text-justify py-4'>
        At the beginning of the game, you’ll be provided with an option that says “new game”. Click
        on this button to create your own server. Make sure to stick to that particular server
        because joining a random server puts your computer at risk of downloading a virus or
        malicious software. You’ll be provided with $800 and a few weapons at the start of the game.
        The money provided can be used to purchase more weapons that are necessary to help you
        eliminate your enemies and win more points! As you continue to achieve victory on every map
        or mission, you earn more money to buy more equipment. One exciting feature of the game is
        locating or diffusing a bomb. Terrorist will try to bomb an area and will then hide the bomb
        in a conspicuous location too tricky for you to find out. Your task will be to prevent them
        from hiding the bomb or If it has already been hidden; fin it and diffuse it. Once you
        succeed, you’ll earn more points and move to another map.
      </p>
      <h3 className='text-2xl text-amber-300'>THE KNIFE!</h3>

      <p className='text-justify py-4'>
        The knife is one of the most important weapons to equip you in CS. Two stabs to the enemy,
        and they’re eliminated. But, the trick is; it requires mastery. Hours of play will teach you
        how to handle the knife in CS properly and guess what, it is entirely free!

          for too long.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever you approach an enemy from the front, do not be static. Move around; crouch as
          often as you can.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use cover during fights to shield you from snipers especially when you’re out in the open.

        Footnote: For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike is better enjoyed with friends. You can start
        by playing against bots, but it can get boring sometimes so invite your friends to download,
        create teams and compete. Let the best team win, good luck and may the odds forever be in
        your favor. Download and Enjoy!
